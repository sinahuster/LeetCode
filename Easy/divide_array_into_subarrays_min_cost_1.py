"""
You are given an array of integers nums of length n.

The cost of an array is the value of its first element. For example, the cost of [1,2,3] is 1 while the cost of [3,4,1] is 3.

You need to divide nums into 3 disjoint contiguous subarrays.

Return the minimum possible sum of the cost of these subarrays.

Constraints:
3 <= n <= 50
1 <= nums[i] <= 50
