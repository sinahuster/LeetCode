"""
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. 
You may return the answer in any order.

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
k is in the range [1, the number of unique elements in the array].
It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
