"""
You are given a 0-indexed integer array piles, where piles[i] represents the number of stones in the ith pile, and an integer k. You should apply the following operation exactly k times:

Choose any piles[i] and remove floor(piles[i] / 2) stones from it.
Notice that you can apply the operation on the same pile more than once.

Return the minimum possible total number of stones remaining after applying the k operations.

floor(x) is the largest integer that is smaller than or equal to x (i.e., rounds x down).

Constraints:
1 <= piles.length <= 10^5
1 <= piles[i] <= 10^4
1 <= k <= 10^5
