"""
Given a directed acyclic graph, with n vertices numbered from 0 to n-1, and an array edges 
where edges[i] = [fromi, toi] represents a directed edge from node fromi to node toi.

Find the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable. 
It's guaranteed that a unique solution exists.

Notice that you can return the vertices in any order.

Constraints:
2 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= edges.length <= min(10^5, n * (n - 1) / 2)
edges[i].length == 2
0 <= fromi, toi < n
All pairs (fromi, toi) are distinct.
